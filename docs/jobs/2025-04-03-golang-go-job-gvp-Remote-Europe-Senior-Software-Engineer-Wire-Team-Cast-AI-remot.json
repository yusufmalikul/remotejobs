  "requirements": "What does the Wire Team do?\nThe Wire Team plays a pivotal, yet behind-the-scenes, role at CAST AI. While they may not directly manage the products that customers purchase, the value they create is indispensable for making all of CAST AI's offerings functional and user-friendly.\nThe team develops a wide array of user-facing features that contribute to a fully realized platform. This includes designing robust authorization and authentication flows, managing user and organization accounts, as well as implementing notifications and audit systems, among other tasks. Furthermore, they create frameworks and tools that enable other internal teams to seamlessly incorporate these capabilities into their own products.\nIn addition to these tasks, the Wire Team is also responsible for implementing enterprise-level Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations as a self-service feature. They work on integrating billing systems with various cloud marketplaces and oversee the management of platform entitlements.\nIn essence, the Wire Team's efforts are crucial to the very existence of our platform. Their mission is to elevate the user experience, regardless of whether the customer is a small startup or a large enterprise.\nHow Do We Operate?\nAt CAST AI, we specifically seek out Software Engineers rather than Software Developers. This distinction is not merely semantic; it underscores a profound difference in responsibilities and expectations. Let's delve into what sets the two apart.\nA Software Engineer is responsible for overseeing the entire lifecycle of a system, starting from its conceptual genesis to its continuous delivery of value to customers. When a high-value feature is identified and properly prioritized, an engineer takes ownership. The task entails not just coding but also meticulously reviewing the technical architecture, design, and feasibility of the feature. Beyond functional aspects, we pay heed to:\nTestability\nAdaptability\nPerformance and Scalability\nDeployment and Compatibility\nDebugging and Operational Management.\nThroughout this comprehensive process, collaboration is key. While engineers are accountable for end-to-end delivery, they are also encouraged to consult with peers to arrive at the most effective solutions. The capacity to work both independently and as part of a team is essential.\nTo expedite delivery, we have devised a suite of proprietary tools that assist us in various aspects of development. Engineers periodically switch roles to write automated end-to-end tests, optimise our GitOps-enabled continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, or fine-tune our observability stack. We even have a rotation for passive on-call duties to promptly address any issues that arise within our codebase.\nIt's worth noting that we do not employ separate DevOps or QA roles within our engineering team. Self-reliance is vital: we automate everything and construct our own tooling. Therefore, a broad systems-oriented perspective - going beyond mere software development - is indispensable for success within our team.\nOur mantra is straightforward: we build it, we test it, we ship it and we operate it.\nHere are some of the tools we use daily:\nGoLang is our language\nKubernetes is our core product\nAWS, GCP, and Azure are the clouds we  operate\nPostgres and cloud object storage for persistence\nGCP PubSub for messaging\nGRPC and REST APIs\nWe use GitLab CI with ArgoCD as our GitOps CD engine\nPrometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo for observability\nDeployment charts are written in Helm.\nHaving experience with these tools is not a strict prerequisite for the ideal candidate, but it does offer a competitive edge.\nRequirements:\nYou have to be physically in any of the European countries GMT 0 to GMT +3\nStrong programming skills in Go\nAbility to design and implement complex systems and architectures\nExperience in designing and/or implementing authentication&authorization or billing systems is an advantage\nWorking with very little to no oversight beyond high-level directions\nUnderstand technologies behind key Cloud building blocks (Network, Compute, Storage etc) and our stack (described above)\nStrong written and verbal communication skills in English\nA “yes we can” attitude.\nWhat's in it for you?\nJoin a fast-growing, cutting-edge company that’s redefining cloud-native automation and optimization.\nCollaborate with a global team of cloud experts and innovators, passionate about pushing the boundaries of Kubernetes technology.\nEnjoy a flexible, remote-first work environment with opportunities to travel and engage with customers worldwide.\nReceive a competitive compensation package, equity options, and extensive benefits.\nBenefit from a short feedback loop, where our customer-oriented approach means we ship code changes fast to receive customer feedback immediately.\nExperience focus time with a minimum of meetings, bureaucracy, and overhead.\nDedicate 10% of your time to self-improvement and personal projects.\nEarn a monthly salary from €6500 to €9000 (gross) depending on the level of experience.\nCongrats, You made it to the end of the post!\nIf you feel excited - get on board!",
