  "requirements": "Upvest is on a mission to make investing as easy as spending money. The company empowers businesses to offer a wide range of investment products and the best experience in the field of capital market investment and retirement planning. Upvest’s Investment API is easy to integrate so that fintechs and enterprises alike can save resources and fully focus on their core business.‍\nUpvest is one of the few fintechs in Europe that can provide its B2B clients with the full range of investment opportunities in the areas of principal broking business, proprietary trading, and safe custody business for traditional securities. The company was founded in 2017 by Martin Kassing and currently employs more than 200 people across Europe. Its latest €100m fundraising round (Series C) was led by Hedosophia and Sapphire Venture, with continued support from existing investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, BlackRock, Earlybird, HV Capital, Motive Ventures, and Notion Capital.\nWe currently employ 200+ people across Europe with our headquarters based in Berlin, Germany, and hubs in Tallinn, Estonia, and London, UK. We would consider hiring remotely for this role. If you do want to move to one of our hubs, we’re happy to support your relocation.\nThe role will give you the opportunity to:\n    Make an impact in a true product team with a large ownership scope.\n    Work with cutting-edge technologies (Go is the primary language; it’s okay if you’re willing to switch from another language) without a legacy codebase.\n    Work on improving the reliability of our API.\n    Deliver fast and often. We embrace an agile methodology with a retrospective and demo at the end of the two-week cycle.\n    Design, build and own event-driven, fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable distributed systems using a Microservice architecture powered by Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka and PostgreSQL.\nIt is a plus if you have:\n    Experience with Investment products or the Fintech domain, in general.\n    Experience in event-driven architectures, event streaming, and event sourcing systems.\n    Experience with operating services in a decoupled, event-driven system, leveraging modern observability tooling (e.g. monitoring and tracing).\nYou’re likely to be successful in this role if:\n    You're excited about fintech and building the financial infrastructure of tomorrow.\n    You work with the customer in mind.\n    You are a true team player and feel energised in diverse teams.\n    You're hungry to learn and eager to grow quickly.\nWhy Upvest?\n    We're working on solving a hard problem: fixing the European securities financial infrastructure that empowers more people to be able to invest. You have the opportunity to contribute to this change.\n    We invest in you. You get a learning development budget and plenty of opportunities to grow in your role.\n    We have a strong engineering culture encouraging knowledge sharing. Learn from our team members who present internally on various software engineering topics as well as internationally at various developer conferences.\n    We take hiring seriously with a strong focus on keeping a high bar when interviewing (equally important is that we hire decent people, who are passionate about their craft and helping us achieve our shared mission).\n    While we're not quite fully-remote, we are committed to being a flexible employer, as we understand you don't have to be in the office to do your best work.\n    We live a culture of empowerment, trust (that we hire the best people and get out of their way) and openness (there's a greater advantage in sharing information than keeping it to ourselves).\nOur values:\n    Learn and grow. We aim high to shape our future. We give and request honest feedback knowing that we develop together. Progression over Perfection.\n    Team first. We make it easy for others. We value our differences and are open to others' opinions. We win and celebrate together! Team over Egos.\n    Own the outcome. Whether we win or we lose, we stand together. We are proactive and get the job done. Outcome over Process.\n    Tell the story. We always start with the why. We share knowledge to empower others. Transparency over Complexity.\nUpvest is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees",
